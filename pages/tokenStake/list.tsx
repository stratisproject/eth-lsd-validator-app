              <div>
                Staking rewards in the StaFi protocol are influenced by various
                factors including the total amount of native tokens staked and
                redeemed, the staking rewards earned, slash occurrences,
                penalties, and the commission ratio. Slashing events, caused by
                disconnection or malicious behavior of validator nodes, could
                potentially reduce rewards; however, StaFi mitigates this risk
                by diversifying the staking funds across multiple validators
                with clean records and requiring them to provide additional
                deposits as collaterals. The staking reward claim status and the
                timing of claims on the original chain can also affect staking
                rewards.
